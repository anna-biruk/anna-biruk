### Glad to see you here!  

- üíª  I‚Äôm a **Front-end Software Engineer**
- ‚ùóThree years of experience with React/Redux  
- ‚ö° Some experience with Node.js
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently open to work

I am a hard-working person, so I am ready to spend a lot of time learning new things and doing work. I am not scared of new tasks and always finish everything I start.

**My projects:**
- **AceCode**

AceCode is a platform that helps engineers pass their coding interviews and increase their salary offers.

**Main stack:** React, Gatsby, Material UI, GraphQL Apollo Server, Apollo Client, Express.js, Lodash


**Responsibilities:**

- Development of web applications;
- Participation in the evaluation, planning, and development of the project architecture;
- Active participation in the code review and meetings with the client;

**Achievements:**

- Successfully enhanced user experience and decreased the number of UI bugs by proposing and implementing a mobile-first approach to the development. It was needed because the vast majority of users were mobile users.
- Improved page loading speed and overall performance of the website by researching and breaking down bundle into smaller pieces and implementing lazy-loading.
- Improved the API by replacing the old unstructured REST-like API endpoints with GraphQL which eliminated network round-trips and improved user experience because they started to see the required information faster.


- **QS.cafe**

QS.cafe is a project, which helps restaurants increase traffic by running smart and cost-efficient advertising campaigns. We create QR-code menus for restaurants with an attractive and simple design.

**Main stack:** React, Redux, Material UI, Express, REST API, PostgreSQL

**Achievements:**

- Designed and developed REST API for the platform.
- Improved the internal admin panel by making a reusable component library which increased the speed of refactoring and delivering new features.
- Built the tenant app from scratch. Designed the architecture, and collaborated with the product team to figure out the requirements. It was a big piece of work that I owned from 0 to production.
- Provided timely and effective support and bug fixes for the restaurant visitor app, resulting in a higher level of customer satisfaction

I had a significant impact on the platform becoming more efficient and user-friendly which resulted in acquiring more customers and great feedback from the end users.
